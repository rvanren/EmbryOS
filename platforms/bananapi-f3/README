To boot EmbryOS on the Banana Pi F3, do the following:

- first create a Linux image which you can download and flash onto an microSD card
    bianbu-25.04-desktop-k1-v3.0-release-20250725125828.img.zip
- now mount this on Linux and go to /media/$USER/bootfs
- rename or remove the following files to interrupt the boot process:
    - env_k1-x.txt
    - initrd.img-6.6.63
    - vmlinuz-6.6.63
- in one of the chapters, run "make bananapi"
- copy everything in platforms/bananapi to /media/$USER/bootfs
- insert the microSD card into the Banana Pi and boot

This will probably stop at the U-Boot prompt.

Enter the following magic commands and reboot:

    setenv bootcmd 'ext4load mmc 0:5 0x600000 /bananapi.uImage; ext4load mmc 0:5 0x31000000 /spacemit/6.6.63/k1-x_deb1.dtb; fdt addr 0x31000000; bootm 0x600000 - 0x31000000'
    saveenv

This should boot EmbryOS
