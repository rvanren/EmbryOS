\chapter{Hello World}

Before we dive into kernel code, let's set up a clean, reproducible environment.
This chapter will guide you through creating a Docker container that can build
and run our operating system, \textbf{EmbryOS}, on a RISC\textendash V
emulator.  By the end, we will make the machine print ``Hello~World'' using a
single UART register.

\section{Why Docker?}

Different computers have different toolchains and library versions.  Using a
container guarantees that everyone---on macOS, Windows, or Linux---is building
the same thing.  We will use Docker to install the RISC\textendash V compiler
and QEMU emulator inside a self-contained Ubuntu environment.

\section{Project Layout}

Each chapter comes with its own directory under \texttt{code/}:

\begin{verbatim}
code/
 +- chapter0/
 +- chapter1/
 |   +- Dockerfile
 |   +- Makefile
 |   +- main.c
 |   +- start.S
 |   \- linker.ld
 \- ...
\end{verbatim}

You can open these files in a simple text editor such as \texttt{nano} (already
included in the container) or your favorite local editor if you mount the
directory into Docker.
