\section{The Linker Script}

The last piece of our ``Hello World'' system is the linker script,
\texttt{hello.lds}.  A linker script tells the linker how to arrange the
different sections of code and data in memory.  Without it, the compiler would
produce object files but not know where to place them in physical memory.

Listing~\ref{lst:hello_lds} shows the script we use for EmbryOS.  It declares a
single region of memory, starting at \texttt{0x80000000}, and places all code
and data there.  The \texttt{\_start} symbol defined in the assembly file is set
as the program’s entry point.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Here is what the main parts mean:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\texttt{MEMORY}} defines a single block of RAM starting at
        \texttt{0x80000000}.  This matches the QEMU \texttt{sifive\_u} machine’s
        default memory map.
  \item \textbf{\texttt{ENTRY(\_start)}} tells the linker that the program should
        begin at the symbol \texttt{\_start}, which we defined in the assembly
        file.
  \item Each \textbf{section} (\texttt{.text}, \texttt{.rodata},
        \texttt{.data}, \texttt{.bss}) gathers code and data from all compiled
        object files and places them sequentially in RAM.
  \item \textbf{Alignment directives} (\texttt{ALIGN(8)}) ensure proper
        alignment for 64-bit accesses, even though we are running a 32-bit CPU.
  \item The \textbf{heap symbols} \texttt{frames} and
        \texttt{\_\_frames\_end} reserve an area for dynamic allocation later.
\end{itemize}

At this point, the entire system layout is defined:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\texttt{0x80000000} & --- code (\texttt{.text}, \texttt{.rodata}) \\
\texttt{0x80200000} & --- heap end (\texttt{\_\_frames\_end}) \\
\texttt{0x80400000} & --- stack top (set in assembly)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\medskip
\noindent
When the linker combines all object files according to this script, the result
is a single binary image (\texttt{hello.bin}) that QEMU can load directly into
RAM and start executing from \texttt{0x80000000}.

\bigskip
\noindent
This completes Chapter~1.  You now have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A Docker environment that builds EmbryOS reproducibly;
  \item A Makefile that compiles, links, and runs the system;
  \item Minimal assembly and C code that boot the machine and print text;
  \item A linker script that defines how the program fits into memory.
\end{itemize}
